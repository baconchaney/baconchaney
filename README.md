<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Chris</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a passionate web developer based in the UK and Lead Developer over at Pharmacy Mentor.</h3>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [StagefrightsPlay](https://github.com/baconchaney/StagefrightsPlay) & [Woocommerce Gift Options - plugin](https://github.com/baconchaney/woocommerce-gift-options)

<h3 align="center">Here's some examples of websites I have designed/developed</h3>
<p align="left"><a href="https://iroaduk.com/" target="_blank">iRoad UK</a>. I was asked to closely follow the design of the global iRoad website to create a website for the UK Distributor. The e-commerce website was built using Wordpress as the CMS and Woocommerce to provide the majority of the e-commerce functionality.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="https://www.cookiedoughclub.co.uk/" target="_blank">Cookie Dough Club</a>. Built using Wordpress, I created the design following given by the customer and the logo they already had and built the custom theme from the ground up. A custom plugin was also created to extend the mix and match functionality provided by another plugin.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="https://tunstallfinancialmanagement.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tunstall Financial Management</a>. I was sub-contracted by RHDC to develop a website for their customer. RHDC provided the design in flat Photoshop files and between us planned how the data would be structured. Again the website uses Wordpress as its CMS and the theme was developed from start to finish.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="https://www.alchemillarestaurant.uk/" target="_blank"><del>Alchemilla Restaurant Nottingham</del></a>. The website has since gone through a revamp so the live site is no longer the one I built.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="https://www.fdoncaster.com/" target="_blank">F Doncaster Ltd</a>. This e-commerce website was launched at the end of 2018 for a local butcher to be able to have an online presence and enable them to sell their products online to the local area. When the lockdowns first started, the website was developed further to enable collection's and deliveries so they could continue to operate during a time when otherwise they would have been forced to temporarily close.</p>
